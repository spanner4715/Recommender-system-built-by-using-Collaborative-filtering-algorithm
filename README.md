# Recommender-system-built-by-using-Collaborative-filtering-algorithm
Whether we browse a YouTube video, or reviwing an Amazon product, it will come across a collaborative filtering recommendation system that will suggest us what products users may like, or purchase.  Recommendation system employ the past purchase pattern of their users to predict which other products they may be interested in and likely to purchase. Recommending the right products gives a significant advantage to the business since a major portion of the revenue is generated through recommendations.
## Collaborative Filtering Recommender System
The Collaborative Filtering algorithm is popular on online streaming platforms and e-commerce sites. Customers interact with each product (whether it is a movie or product) by reviews/rating. Collaborative filtering systems mainly apply the similarity index-based technique where they select some users depending on their similarity features to the active user
### Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering Algorithms
The memory-based Collaborative Filtering uses a rating system to predict a userâ€™s preferences by considering the similar patterns of users
#### 1. User-Based Collaborative Filtering
User-based collaborative filtering focuses on similar users depending on their interest, contacts, and demographics. Generally, social medias use this method to suggest users to other users based on their behavior patterns
#### 2. Item-Based Collaborative Filtering
The item-based filtering approach selects new recommendations depending on the past interactions relevant to the target user. It prioritizes all the items the particular user has previously used. After that, it will assess resemble products with similar ratings and forms clusters (nearest neighbors). It then offers new recommendations from these clusters to the target user

## Cosine Similarity
Cosine similarity refers to the cosine value of the angle between two vectors in an n-dimensional area. It can be used to evaluate how similar two items or products are to one another, regardless of their size or shape. The formula of cosine similarity: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103509243/195860450-162dff0a-8857-456c-ad0a-9fcbdf6bc260.png)
